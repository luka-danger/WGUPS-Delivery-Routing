# WGUPS Delivery Routing 

C950: Data Structures and Algorithms 2

Western Governors University

By Nate Edge

## Description: 
Package Delivery Algorithm based on the Traveling Salesman Problem. The program finds the shortest distance to deliver all packages (117.3 miles) to various addresses in the Salt Lake City metro area.

## Primary Data Structure and Algorithm: 
Nearest Neighbor Algorithm 

Hash Map 

## Run-Time Complexity: 
O(n) + O(1) + O(n) + O(n) + O(n^2) + O(n) + O(n^2) ---> O(n^2)

## Requirements
Deliver all packages on time, in less than 140 miles, following all requirements:
<ul>
<li> Deliver all packages on time
<li> Deliver all packages in less than 140 miles
<li> No more than 16 packages per truck
<li> Can use 3 trucks, but only 2 drivers. 
<li> Return all 3 trucks to the hub at the end of the day
</ul>
